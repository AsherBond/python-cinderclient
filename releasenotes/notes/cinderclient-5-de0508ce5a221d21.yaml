    This is a major version release of python-cinderclient. Backwards
    compatibility has been removed for some long standing deprecations and
    support for the Cinder v1 API has been removed. Prior to upgrading to this
    release, ensure all Cinder services that need to be managed are 13.0.0
    (Rocky) or later.
